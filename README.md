# ReactNativeSampleChat
A collection of hopefully not-terrible practices to consider when building a React Native app

## The Big Idea

There's plenty of React and React Native tutorials out there that exercise a particular concept or two. I've been looking at a lot of these, and wanted to collect together everything I liked into one project; in this case, something that looks vaguely like a first grader building a social networking client. Consider this part-starter pack, navigation/ MobX/ whatever tutorial, demonstration of folder structure, design patterns, and ES6 constructs. Maybe I'm the only one in the world who has this issue, but sometimes I find it a bit difficult to take all of these little bits and robotically apply them wholistically to a new project without missing something, or at least a bit tedious rebuilding these bits in yet another project after doing something else for the last six months or so. So here it is, standing as either a testament to either my foresight or forgetfulness.

A few notes:
* Most of this stuff I haven't just made up. I try to give credit where it's due.
* This app is intentionally shallow and ugly. I build just enough to demonstrate the concept and precious little more than that.
* I will go into agonizing detail about things you might find trivial (looking at you, Mr. Level 97 React Wizard). This is not for you, but a reflection of stupid questions I've stumbled on and smart questions asked of me when trying to teach this stuff.

## Running the Sample

### Prerequisites
* You did all [this stuff](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to get React Native working.

### Steps (iOS simulator)
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `react-native link`
3. Run `react-native run-ios`

### Steps (Android simulator)
I know they're almost the same, but I haven't run this on Android yet (always a bear installing that ), so let me make sure it works first.
